# Second Business Testing Setup

## Database Status: ✅ ORIGINAL DATA RESTORED

Your development environment has been restored with original test data:
- **Jobs**: 10 records (Mark & Will's projects)  
- **Employees**: 10 records (John, Sarah, Mike, etc.)
- **Timesheets**: Ready for new entries
- **Full functionality**: All features preserved

## How to Create Clean Version for Second Business:

## What the Second Business Gets:

### Fresh Start Environment
- Clean database with no existing data
- Full functionality to create their own:
  - Employee profiles  
  - Job entries
  - Timesheet submissions
  - Project management setup

### Complete Feature Access
- Admin dashboard with full controls
- Staff timesheet interface
- Email notification system
- PDF generation and exports
- Mobile-responsive design
- Role-based access (admin/staff)

### Independent Testing
- No interference with primary business data
- Separate authentication/user accounts
- Own job/client/project manager setup
- Custom email configurations

## Next Steps:

### Option A: Fork Your Replit (Recommended)
1. **Go to your Replit dashboard**
2. **Click the "Fork" button** on your current project
3. **Name it**: "BuildFlow-Pro-Business2" 
4. **Clear the database** in the new fork
5. **Deploy the clean fork** → Second business gets their own URL

### Option B: Create Database Reset Script
1. **Add a reset endpoint** to clear all data
2. **Deploy current version** 
3. **Run reset** before sharing with second business
4. **They get clean environment** with same URL

## Benefits of Forking:
- ✅ **Complete separation** - No risk of data mixing
- ✅ **Independent URLs** - Each business has their own link  
- ✅ **Safe testing** - Your original stays untouched
- ✅ **Easy management** - Clear separation in your dashboard
