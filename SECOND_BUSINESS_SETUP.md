### Independent Testing

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy this clean version** → Get unique URL for second business
2. **Share testing URL** → They can access immediately  
3. **Provide admin credentials** → Full setup access
4. **Setup guidance** → Help them create initial data

The second business can now test the complete BuildFlow Pro system with their own data, completely isolated from your primary testing environment.
